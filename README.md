An R project finding the difficulty level of candy crush saga.

Candy Crush Saga is a hit mobile game developed by King (part of Activision|Blizzard) that is played by millions of people all around the world. The game is structured as a series of levels where players need to match similar candy together to (hopefully) clear the level and keep progressing on the level map. 

Candy Crush has more than 3000 levels, and new ones are added every week. That is a lot of levels! And with that many levels, it's important to get level difficulty just right. Too easy and the game gets boring, too hard and players become frustrated and quit playing.

In this project, we will see how we can use data collected from players to estimate level difficulty. Let's start by loading in the packages we're going to need.
